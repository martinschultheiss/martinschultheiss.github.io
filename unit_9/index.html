  			<p class="column2">Because the world is changing so fast, and we are needing to adapt so quickly, it is not uncomomon to lack a specific skill within you business. Outsourcing often leads to the skills without the culture fit. We not only provide you with the skills, we are already interwoven into your culture and strategy.</p>
  			<p class="column2">Teamwork is such a "cliche" word used to look politically correct. frequently there is little belief behind the use of the word, and application is scarce. We have defined what you can expect from us above. We believe that in a business, there is only one side, the business side. You either adding to the business, or you are detracting from the business, there is no such thing as a neutral impact.</p>
  			<p class="column2">The pareto principle has stood the test of time. It is more relevant than ever before. In an era where we have so much access to information, it is becoming critical to only focus on the 20% that will add 80% of the value. This is a deliberate choice and there are deliberate actions required.</p>
